# Simple bootloader
This is the repo for the bootloader series on my blog mayabruin.com

## How to use this code
The code is split into parts, which each have their own folder. Every folder contains the working example corresponding to the same part in the blogpost series.
In each of these folders a separate readme file is included with instructions on how to produce a binary, and how to run it using qemu.
